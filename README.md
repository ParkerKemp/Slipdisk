# Slipdisk
Slipdisk is a Minecraft plugin which allows players to create two-way portals called "slips". Nodes are placed by placing signs and typing "#slip" on the top row. Once two nodes have been placed, players may click on them to teleport back and forth.

Slipdisk was designed with semi-vanilla Minecraft in mind. Many semi-vanilla servers face the dilemma of wanting to avoid immersion-ruining teleportation while also trying to keep their community connected within the game, where many players feel compelled to build their houses far away from everyone else. 

Slips solve this problem by allowing players to distance themselves geographically while remaining in arm's reach of each other. On Spinalcraft, players are encouraged to keep one slip node in the spawn area and one at their base. This creates a convenient network of fast travel between bases, while at the same time preventing players from ruining their own experience by abusing the "/tp" command.

Slipdisk is part of the Spinalcraft Suite, and as of right now is not designed for general compatibility with other servers (however, that may be coming soon).
